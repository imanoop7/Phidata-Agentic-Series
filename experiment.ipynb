      "* 2 large eggs\n",
      "* 1 cup of milk\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n",

      "2. **Whisk the eggs**: In a shallow dish, whisk together the eggs, milk, and cinnamon until well combined.\n",
      "3. **Dip the bread**: Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, coating both sides evenly.\n",
      "4. **Cook the French toast**: Place the coated bread slices on the preheated pan or griddle. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.\n",
